# poetry-wrapper

## Introduction

Poetry wrapper allows you to use multiple version of Poetry and use your existing shell instead of starting a new one.

The advantage of this that you can use your most recent shell history when you enter a shell and it doesn't get cluttered by commands
entered by Poetry.

## Installation

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meeuw/poetry-wrapper/master/install-poetry.py | python - --version 1.1.6
```

The installation will update your `.bashrc`, you should start a new shell or manually execute the lines added by the installer.
